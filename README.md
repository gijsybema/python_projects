# DataCamp Python Projects
This repository contains a collection of small projects I completed while working through DataCamp courses and projects. 
Each project applies Python to real-world data problems, showcasing skills in data analysis, visualization, and machine learning.
The goal of this repository is to serve as part of my portfolio of hands-on work demonstrating my ability to clean, analyze, and communicate insights from data.

| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Analyzing Crime in Los Angeles**       | Analyzed a crime dataset to uncover relationships with time, area and age group.                       | `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`                         |
| **Clustering Antarctic Penguin Species** | Built a k-means clustering model to cluster different penguin species.                                 | `scikit-learn`, `kmeans`, `matpltlib`                     |
| **Investigating Netflix Movies**         | Explored a Netflix dataset to uncover insights about movie length and genre.                           | `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`                           |
| **Voltbike Innovations**                 | Cleaned and analyzed an ebike dataset to uncover relationships with production costs and customer satisfaction | `pandas`, `numpy`                                 |


## Skills Demonstrated
- Python for Data Science: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
- Data Wrangling: cleaning, reshaping, aggregating datasets
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): identifying patterns, trends, and insights
- Data Visualization: communicating results with clear plots and charts
- Machine Learning: clustering, classification & regression models

## ðŸ“Œ Notes
- Datasets used here are provided by DataCamp for educational purposes.
- These projects were completed as part of my data science learning journey, and serve as a portfolio of applied Python skills.
